 Name: Rajesh Upadhayaya
 
 
  for one dimension elementaryCa.
  I filled the method evolve based on the rule given. iterating the for loop over the grid
  and then  checking for the eight condition.  and assiging it with the given behaviour. 
 I also added some code on the elementaryCA calss for the scanner part . reading from the bufferedreader.

  Game of life.

  I have create one class  game .It is a constructor class. it consits of  all the logic for my game of life.
    it consists of the constructor game  and methor fillGrid,sketch,numNeighbour,nextGen.
    fillGrid, first fill the grid with the intital condition given. and then sketch method 
    filled that grid with the color and then the numNeighbour find the number of neighbour on that cell.
     and then nextGen finds the next generation based on the number of the neighbour form the numneighbour method.
     
  Game of Life class contains the code for the scanner part asking for the filpath or generate file and then 
  it claso coantaine the timer code with animation timer. and also form a game forn Game constructor and then 
  it uses thoses mehtod to create game of life.
  
   LangtonsLoop
   I am not successfully able to  complete the langtons loop game. I created the 4 class same as the elementaryCA. wiht the grid
   ,cell, timer and LangtonsLoop clas. 
   timer create a timer for the Langtons loop. similar to ElementaryCA and the cell class  creates the cell class with  many staet with their color.
   finally grid class creats the two dimensional grid for the Langton loops. 
   LGrid consists of the constructor LGrid and the gridDisplay mehtod that dispaly the initial starte of the grid. 
   the LangtondLoop class consists of the  readin of the intitial file and the rule file and it call the grid construator that runs the intitla condition.
